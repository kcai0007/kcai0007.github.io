== Description ==

Apester’s WordPress plugin allows content creators to easily add interactive mobile-friendly engagements, such as polls, quizzes, videos, or Stories, into their WordPress posts. Seamlessly embed the content created on [Apester](https://www.apester.com) with a single click to enrich and boost engagement on your WP site.

Engage your readers with a central question that your content raises, look for general sentiment on the topic, or test the readers’ knowledge. Increase engagement by implementing Apester’s Playlist code to distribute the content automatically at scale and learn more about your readers with Apester’s analytics dashboard, deriving insights about the performance of your content.

Apester’s interactive units are created and implemented on a daily basis across dozens of publisher sites such as TIME, Rolling Stone, Variety, Hollywood Life, The Telegraph, The Independent, London Evening Standard, NME, Ideal Home, and RTL. The interactive content helps these publishers lift editorial KPIs such as:

* Engagement rate (CTR)
* Time-on-page
* Social share
* Audience building

= Introduction =
* Instantly find and embed relevant Apester interactive units
* Automatically distribute more content on your WP site with Playlist
* Build your audience with Analytics: enjoy clear visibility into your unit’s performance from a single dashboard.

= How to embed Apester Units =
Easily embed an Apester unit (e.g. poll, quiz) into your article or enter a Playlist code into all your articles.
* Playlist is a one-time code that automatically rotates pre-selected Apester units on every page and article on your site. Just setup the playlist embed in [plugin settings](https://help.apester.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002063605-Playlist-for-WP-Sites).
* To embed one unit, go into the Apester editor, copy the embed code and paste it into the post visual editor in the location where you want it to show.

== FAQ ==

**Why should I use the Apester WordPress Plugin?**<br />
The Apester plugin gives you quick and easy access to the Apester units you have already created and gives you a simple and easy way to embed the units into your WordPress site.

**Is the Apester WordPress Plugin supported on Mobile and Desktop?**<br />
Absolutely! Just as readers consume content both on mobile and desktop, Apester’s units are compatible with all digital platforms.

**How can I create an Apester unit?**<br />
Create the unit in the Apester [editor](https://create.apester.com) and then copy the code into your WP post.

On versions older than WP 5, you’ll see the Apester logo on your visual editor. After clicking on it, a“Create New” button will pop up on the screen that directs users to Apester Editor where they can start creating their Apester units.

**How do I embed an Apester unit?**<br />
After creating a poll, quiz, or personality test on Apester’s editor, click ‘publish’, and copy the embed code into WP.

On WP versions older than 5, you’ll see the Apester logo on your visual editor. Click on it and search and/or sort for any created item, and select one of your own. Click on the “Embed” button to embed them on your post.
Read more about it [here](https://help.apester.com/hc/en-us/articles/205545291-How-do-I-Embed-a-Unit-Into-my-Website).

**How do I embed the Apester Playlist?**<br />
Go into the plugin settings, add the Apester ‘channel-token’, and select a location where you would like to implement the Playlist. You’ll find a step-by-step guide [here](https://help.apester.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002063605-Playlist-for-WP-Sites).

**I used to have a Red Apester Logo on the visual editor. Why can’t I find it now?**<br />
With versions WP 5 and above, you’ll have to install the [TinyMCE Advanced](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) plugin to get the Apester logo from earlier versions.

If you are using WP 4.9 or below, there are two reasons as to why you might not be seeing the Apester logo. Firstly, check you are not using the
text editor when writing on your page, and that you have selected the [visual editor](https://en.support.wordpress.com/visual-editor/). If you can’t find the visual editor, you might have it disabled. Head to your “Users” tab → “Your Profile” and uncheck the checkbox for disabling the visual editor when editing.

**I have another question that is not here!**<br />
